# Lab 2 — Basic Windows Command Line & PowerShell

## Purpose
This lab helps me practice basic Windows command-line and PowerShell commands. These are common tools used in IT support for checking networks, diagnosing problems, and getting system information.

## Tools Used
- Windows 11
- Command Prompt (run as Administrator)
- PowerShell (run as Administrator)

## Commands I Used and What They Do

### Command Prompt (CMD)
1. `ipconfig`  
   - Shows my computer’s network information (IP address, gateway).

2. `ping google.com`  
   - Tests if my internet connection can reach Google.

3. `tracert google.com`  
   - Shows the path my connection takes to reach Google.

4. `systeminfo`  
   - Shows a summary of my system (OS version, memory, updates, etc).

### PowerShell
1. `Get-Process`  
   - Shows all running programs and background processes.

2. `Get-Service`  
   - Shows Windows services and whether they are running or stopped.

3. (Optional) `Get-ComputerInfo`  
   - Shows detailed system information.

## Screenshots
All screenshots are saved in the **screenshots** folder and include:
